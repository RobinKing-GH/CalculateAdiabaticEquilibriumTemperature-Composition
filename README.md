# CalculateAdiabaticEquilibriumTemperature-Composition
In python language, the adiabatic equilibrium temperature and composition of hydrocarbon components are calculated by the principle of minimum Gibbs free energy.
The equilibrium temperature of adiabatic process is calculated interatively by dichotomy. Then the minimum Gibbs free energy principle is used to calculte its equilibrium composition. The current suppoeted components inculde: H2, CH4, CO, CO2, O2, H2O, N2, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H8, C6H6, C10H8, soot and O2. The thermodynamic parameters of related components are expressed by NASA7 format polynomial.
